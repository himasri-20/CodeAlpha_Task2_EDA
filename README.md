# CodeAlpha Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project is part of my CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to identify trends, patterns, anomalies, and validate assumptions using visualizations.

##  Objectives
- Ask meaningful questions about the dataset
- Explore data structure and detect data issues
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Test hypotheses and validate assumptions
- Detect data issues for further analysis

##Dataset
The dataset used is Titanic.csv, which contains passenger details such as:
Survived – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass – Passenger class
Sex – Gender
Age – Passenger age
Fare – Ticket fare
Embarked – Port of embarkation
 Download Titanic dataset from: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
Save it as titanic.csv in the same folder as the script.


##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
